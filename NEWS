NEWS/ChangeLog for proj4 R package

1.0-11	2022-01-31
    *	improve detection of correct flags using pkg-config where
	available including static versions. Unless --enable-proj6
	is used it will use proj4 API if avaiable.

    *	add support for UCRT Windows builds

1.0-10.1 (CRAN NMU, Brian Ripley)
    *	force C++ in configure tests

1.0-10	2020-03-03
    *	remove dead links from the documentation

1.0-9	2020-03-02
    *	update proj4 to support PROJ5 and PROJ6. Given all the issues
	with the new PROJ6 API we try to use PROJ4 API wherever
	possible. It is, however, possible to force the use of PROJ6
	API even if PROJ4 is available by specifying --enable-proj6
	configure flag. This should be only used with caution as it
	may have adverse effects on the projection results.

	When PROJ6 API is used, we are applying a heuristic
	in ptransform() to try to detect whether degrees are expected
	by PROJ6 instead of radians previously and will convert
	coordinates automatically to preserve the PROJ4 behavior.

    *	use NAMESPACE C symbol registration

    *	2x2 input in project() was ambiguous, it is now defined
	that columns are taken as x and y. Note that previously
	rows were taken which is unintuitive and could lead to bugs
	that are hard to detect.

1.0-8	2012-08-04
    *	remove Windows binaries from the source package, respect
	LOCAL_SOFT environment variable to use local copy,
	otherwise fetch Windows binaries from RForge.net

1.0-7	2011-12-10
    *	use R's CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS for testing in configure,
	addressing issues on systems with non-default proj4
	location which is known by R.

1.0-6	2011-01-31
    *	Update bundled PROJ.4 library for Windows to 4.7.0 and
	include both 32-bit and 64-bit binaries
	(there is no change to the package itself)

1.0-5	2011-01-16
    *	fixed a minor typo in the docs

    *	changed license specification from verbatim form to
	a form that R likes better

1.0-4	2007-06-08
    *	add ellps.default to project() (PROJ4.5.0 always requires an
	ellipsoid or datum)

    *	fix examples to work with PROJ4.5.0

1.0-3	2007-06-06
    *	add Windows support

1.0-2
    *	update documentation

    *	add support for datum transformation via ptransform()

1.0-1
    *	add a namespace

    *	allow projection parameters to be specified in a more flexible
	way including a named vector c(proj='utm',zone=15), a
	list list(proj='utm',zone=15) and an unnamed arguments
	vector c('+proj=utm','+zone=15').

1.0-0
    *	initial version (an intereface to pj_fwd and pj_inv)


Note for Windows: This package contains a static proj4.7.0 binary for
Windows. The NAD files are expected to be installed in c:\proj
